# OpenH3 Windows x64 runtime notice

This notice records the runtime components included in the Windows x64
experience package. The package contains the corresponding upstream license
files at the paths listed below; those files are installed beside the
application under `resources/`.

## Components included in the package

| Component | Version | License / notice | Upstream source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AionCore runtime | v0.2.2 | Apache License 2.0; source URL and build manifest are recorded in `resources/bundled-aioncore/win32-x64/manifest.json` | https://github.com/iOfficeAI/AionCore/releases/tag/v0.2.2 |
| Node.js runtime | v24.11.0 | MIT and bundled third-party notices in `resources/bundled-aioncore/win32-x64/managed-resources/node/node-v24.11.0-win-x64/LICENSE` | https://nodejs.org/download/release/v24.11.0/ |
| npm CLI | v11.6.1 | Artistic License 2.0 and dependency notices in the npm package metadata under the bundled Node installation | https://github.com/npm/cli/tree/v11.6.1 |
| Corepack | v0.34.0 | MIT; license file is included in the bundled Node installation under `node_modules/corepack/LICENSE.md` | https://github.com/nodejs/corepack/tree/v0.34.0 |
| FFmpeg (essentials build) | 7.1.1 | GPL-3.0; see `resources/ffmpeg/LICENSE` and `resources/ffmpeg/README.txt` | https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/commit/db69d06eee |

The adjacent `LICENSE.*` files are unmodified copies of the shipped Node,
npm and Corepack license files and the AionCore v0.2.2 root LICENSE. Node's
license includes the notices for its embedded third-party components. npm's
own license does not replace the licenses of its individual dependencies.
The AionCore tag's root LICENSE is Apache-2.0, while its Cargo workspace
metadata declares MIT; the root LICENSE is preserved verbatim here. Its
Rust dependency license inventory must be assessed separately from this
top-level runtime inventory.

OpenH3 does not ship a separate `bun.exe` or `7z.exe` in the Windows x64
runtime directory. AionCore v0.2.2 is built with Rust, not Bun: its tagged
[release workflow](https://github.com/iOfficeAI/AionCore/blob/v0.2.2/.github/workflows/release.yml)
uses Rust 1.95.0 and `cargo build --release -p aionui-app`.
Its download URL is recorded in the adjacent AionCore manifest. The NSIS
installer uses electron-builder's build-time tooling and
does not expose a standalone 7-Zip executable to end users.

The complete source and corresponding-source obligations for GPL components
are tracked in `../SOURCE-OFFER.md`. This file is an inventory and does not
replace any upstream license text or source offer.
